# Task3_MLops

This task is to automate the process of a perfect model creation by changing the hyperparams based on accuracy rate of model

Pre-requisite:

 1.Jenkins
 2.Docker
 3.Github
 4.Machine learning code



JOB: I have made deeplearning model which already have some layers added for classification ,uses keras for predicting from the mnist dataset. --Load the image from dockers that have keras installed using docker. --Create a pipeline of job1,job2,job3,job4,job5.

Job1 - Load the image that have keras installed in dockerfile.

Job2 - Pull the mnist-keras.py model from github repo directly using jenkins.

Job3 - Jnekins will automatically start doing the job of training the model and dockerfile installed keras file will aumotically start training the code .

Job4 - Train the model and accuracy of model will be predicted.

Job5 - will automatically start the job of adding the convolutinal layers for judging the incerese in accuracy till model didnot reach the accuracy greater than 80%. If container where job is running fails due to any reason , will automatically starts another container.
